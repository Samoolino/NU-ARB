# NU-ARB

ARBX is a Python spot-arbitrage bot for triangular and cross-exchange strategies. The application source is in [`arb_bot/`](arb_bot/), and the operating guide is in [`ARBX_README.md`](ARBX_README.md).

## Windows setup

From the repository root, create and activate a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and run the offline self-test:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r arb_bot\requirements.txt
Set-Location arb_bot
python run.py selftest
```

To run with live market data and virtual funds, stay in `arb_bot` and run:

```powershell
$env:BOT_MODE = "paper"
python run.py --headless
```

The bot defaults to paper mode. Live mode can place real exchange orders; it requires exchange credentials, and cross-exchange live orders require the separate `BOT_CROSS_LIVE=1` opt-in. Arbitrage is risky and profits are not guaranteed. Read the full [operations guide](ARBX_README.md) before configuring exchanges. Never commit API keys.
